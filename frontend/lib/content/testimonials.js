Telemedica LLC provided an approach to my appointment that both efficiently and effective. My doctor was prompt, even early to the appointment, there was a period of introduction and discussion to manage expectation, and then a very professional doctor\'s appointment conducted in the privacy of our spaces.The most positive and best experience to a medical appointment I\'ve ever had. Highly, highly, recommend Telemedica LLC.',

My doctor was punctual, informative, and asked the tough questions and pertinent questions that needed to be asked but still was very respectful and empathetic. I would recommend Telemedica 100 times over to get the job done. They were also very flexible with my schedule to get appointment in as soon as possible',

They\'ve either gone through what you\'re going through, or they know someone who has. In this way, they can help fully capture the severity of symptoms and their impacts on your daily life. Can\'t recommend them enough, they really are worth it!',

		text: 'I had a great experience with Telemedica. They provided exceptional customer focused service for me. It was very easy for me to schedule the appointment, uploading the documents was easy and stress free. The provider was on time for my appointment. She was thorough and very professional and attentive. She made me feel very comfortable, so I was able to share some very, very personal things about my experiences. Not once did I feel like I was being rushed or judged by the provider. It felt good being able to get things off of my chest. Another thing I noted about my provider is she was well prepared for the appointment. It became obvious during our conversation that she had actually read my charts, records and written statements. Yes, I said it, conversation, we had an actual conversation about my experiences, both then and now. I am so very happy TM services came into my life. Speaking Veteran to Veteran, I highly recommend Telemedica Services. We have a listening ear with TELEMEDICA. I am a "Very Satisfied" customer!',

I have never done anything like this before and never thought I had to either. The truth is I don\'t like to be vulnerable but this is the place to be honest and open.I believe this was the right decision for myself and my family.This was my first time talking to a psychologist and I felt truly heard without prejudice. 10/10 recommend for anyone looking to make change for themselves.',
